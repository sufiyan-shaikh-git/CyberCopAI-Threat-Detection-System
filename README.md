📝 Project Overview
CyberCop is a cutting-edge security intelligence tool developed in 2026. It leverages Machine Learning to perform high-speed Static Analysis on Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Unlike traditional antivirus software, CyberCop predicts threats by analyzing the "Structural DNA" of a file, making it effective against Zero-Day malware.

🚀 Key Features
AI-Driven Detection: Powered by the Random Forest Algorithm with 98% Accuracy.

Zero-Execution Safety: Scans files without running them, ensuring host system safety.

Instant Forensic Audit: Automatically logs every scan for future security investigation.

Interactive Dashboard: Futuristic UI with real-time system status monitoring.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Backend: Python (Flask Framework)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Cyber-Theme), JavaScript

AI/ML: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib

Analysis Engine: Pefile (PE Header Extraction)

Automation: Windows Batch Scripting (.bat files)

🧬 How it Works (The Logic)
CyberCop extracts critical features from the PE headers of an uploaded file, such as:

Entropy: To detect packed or encrypted malicious code.

DLL Characteristics: To check for security flags like ASLR and DEP.

Machine ID: To identify the target architecture.

The extracted data is then passed to the pre-trained malware_model.pkl, which classifies the file as either Legitimate or Malicious within seconds.
